During this session, attendees executed 1742 queries in one hour and Starburst handled the workload without any issues! This lab not only demonstrates how to design cumulative tables but also showcases the power of running analytics in the data lake! [Recorded Nov 7, 2023]",

Exploring the advantages and distinctions between notebooks and spark-submit for production jobs, Zach also sheds light on caching, the auto broadcast join threshold, and the effective use of UDFs in PySpark. Closing with expert insights, he offers valuable tips on performance optimization and the optimal language selection for Spark jobs. [Recorded on Dec 7, 2023]",

Through a practical code example, he guides viewers on schema updates and emphasizes the significance of caching. The tutorial extends to showcasing the power of broadcast join, featuring a query with partitioning. Zach concludes by highlighting the advantages of leveraging PySpark UDFs.
